<p>In this page, two commonly used induction methods are applied to prove <strong>the number of vertices of odd degree is even</strong>.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="proof-by-induction-on-edges">Proof by Induction on Edges</h2>
<p>Let $P(m)$ be defined as:   <br />
For an arbitrary $m\in\mathbb{N}$, in any graph with $m$ edges, the number of vertices of odd degree is even.  <br />
<br />
<strong>BASE CASE:</strong> $P(0)$ holds, because a graph with no edge has only isolated vertices, that is, vertices of degree O. Hence, there are an even number (0) of vertices with odd degree. <br />
<br /> 
<strong>INDUCTION STEP:</strong> Assume that (IH) $P(k)$ is true, for an arbitrary $k\in\mathbb{N}$.Now, we want to prove $P(k+1)$ is true. <br />
Let $G$ be a graph with $k+1$ edges. Remove an arbitrary edge $e=\{u, v\}$ from $G$ (note that it could be any edge), so that we now have a graph $G’$ with $k$ edges. By the Induction Hypothesis, the number of vertices with odd degree in $G’$ is even. Denote the number of vertices with odd degree in
$G’$ to be $2a$, where $a\in\mathbb{N}$. Now put back the edge $e$ that we removed earlier. Observe that doing so increases the degree of vertices $u$ and $v$ by one each. We consider the following three cases: <br />
<em>Case 1:</em> Both $u$ and $v$ have odd degree in $G’$. Adding e back would make the degree of both $u$ and $v$ even. Hence, the number of vertices with odd degree becomes $2a-2$. <br />
<em>Case 2:</em> Both $u$ and $v$ have even degree in $G’$.Adding $e$ back would make the degree of both $u$ and $v$ odd. Hence, the number of vertices with odd degree becomes $2a+2$.  <br />
<em>Case 3:</em> Exactly one of $u$ and $v$ has odd degree in $G$. Without losing generosity, assume $u$ has an odd degree and $v$ has an even degree in $G$. Adding $e$ back would result in $u$ with an even degree and $u$ with an odd degree. Hence, the number of vertices with odd degree would stay unchanged ($2a$).   <br />
In all cases, the number of odd degree vertices in $G$ is even. Thus, we have shown our claim is true when $m=k+1$, concluding the Induction Step and completing the proof.</p>

<h2 id="proof-by-induction-on-vertices">Proof by Induction on Vertices</h2>
<p>Let $P(n)$ be defined as:  <br />
For an arbitrary $n\in\mathbb{Z^+}$, in any graph with $n$ vertices, the number of vertices of odd degree is even.  <br />
<br /> 
<strong>BASE CASE:</strong> $P(1)$ holds, because a graph with 1 vertex is an edgeless graph, that is, the graph contains one vertex of degree O. Hence, there are an even number (0) of vertices with odd degree.  <br />
<br /> 
<strong>INDUCTION STEP:</strong> Assume that (IH) $P(k)$ is true, for an arbitrary $k\in\mathbb{Z^+}$. Now, we want to prove $P(k+1)$ is true.  <br />
Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with $k+ 1$ vertices. Let $v\in V$ be arbitrary. We partition $V$ into the following sets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$X$ = the neighbors of $u$ with even degree in $G$.</li>
  <li>$Y$ = the neighbors of $u$ with odd degree in $G$.</li>
  <li>$R$ = vertices not adjacent to $u$ with even degree in $G$.</li>
  <li>$S$ = vertices not adjacent to $u$ with odd degree in $G$.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since $Y$ and $S$ partition the set of odd-degree vertices in $G$, want to show $|Y|$+$|S|$ is even.   <br />
Remove $v$ with degree $\alpha$ from $G$, so that we now have a graph $G’$ with $k$ vertices.  <br />
<em>Case 1:</em> $\alpha$ is even. Then $\alpha=2k$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$. This means that $|X|+|Y|=2k$, so $|X|$ and $|Y|$ have the same parity.  <br />
The degree of each neighbor of $v$ decreased by 1, so all $x\in X$ in $G$ became odd degree vertices in $G’$. By the Induction Hypothesis, the number of vertices with odd degree in $G’$ is even. Denote the number of vertices with odd degree in $G’$ to be $2\alpha$, where $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}$. In $G’$ this gives $|X|+|S|=2a$, since $|X|$ represents the odd-degree vertices
unaffected by the removal of $v$. Note that $|X|$ and $|S|$ must have the same parity.  <br />
Now put back the vertex $v$ that we removed earlier. Observe that doing so increases the degree of each of the neighbors of $v$ by 1. All vertices in $X$ now have even degree, and all vertices in $Y$ have odd degree again.
Since $|X|$ and $|S|$ have the same parity, and we already know $|X|$ and $|Y|$ have the same parity, then$|X|$, $|Y|$, $|S|$ all have the same parity. This means $|Y|+|S|$ is even. <br />
<em>Case 2:</em> $\alpha$ is odd. (We include $v$ in $S$). Then $\alpha=2k+1$, $k\in\mathbb{N}$. This means that $|X|+|Y|=2k+1$, so $|X|$ and $|Y|$ have opposite parity.    <br />
The degree of each neighbor of $v$ decreased by 1, so all $x\in X$ in $G$ became odd degree vertices in $G’$. By the Induction Hypothesis, the number of vertices with odd degree in $G’$ is even. Denote the number of vertices with odd degree in $G’$ to be $2\alpha$, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$. In $G’$ this gives$|X|+|S|=2\alpha$, since $|X|$ now represents the new odd vertices in $G$, and $S’=S\backslash\{v\}$ since $v$ had odd degree, removing it means $|S’| =|S|-1$ since all other vertices in $S$ are unaffected. Note that$|X|+|S’|=2\alpha$, or $|X|+|S|=2\alpha+1$. This means $|X|$ and $|S|$ have opposite parity.     <br />
Now put back the vertex $v$ that we removed earlier. Observe that doing so increases the degree of each of the neighbors of $v$ by 1. All vertices in $X$ now have even degree, and all vertices in $Y$ have odd degree again.  <br />
Since $|X|$ and $|S|$ must have the opposite party, and $|X|$ and $|Y|$ have opposite parity, we have that $|Y|$ and $|S|$ have the same parity. This means $|Y|+|S|$ is even.    <br />
In all cases, the number of odd degree vertices in $G$ is even. Thus, we have shown the claim is true when $m=k+1$, concluding the Induction Step and completing the proof.
